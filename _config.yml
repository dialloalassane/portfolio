description: I am a quantitative researcher and academic instructor specializing in applied mathematics, financial engineering, artificial intelligence, and computational finance. My work centers on quantitative modeling, derivative pricing, risk management, and machine learning particularly deep reinforcement learning applied to portfolio optimization and financial decision-making.
I hold Master’s degrees in Financial Engineering (Université Paris Diderot) and Applied Mathematics (École Centrale Paris) with high honors, and I currently work as a Quantitative Analyst developing and validating interest rate and FX pricing models in Python. Alongside industry research, I teach mathematics, computer science, financial markets, and AI, and I design advanced courses in machine learning, stochastic modeling, and quantitative risk management.
